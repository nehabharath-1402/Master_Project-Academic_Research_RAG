the results in Figure 7, it emerges that CrossRAG is robust to the varying document order. Instead, MultiRAG is more sen- sitive to retrieval order; this phenomenon emerges in Llama-3-8b and less markedly in Command-R and GPT-4o. This further indicates that the lan- guage sensitivity of documents is a drawback to the final performance, and operating a translation process or system such as CrossRAG improves performance by making it more robust to scenarios where retrieved documents may not be
