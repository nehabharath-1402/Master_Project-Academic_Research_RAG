the language must be the same as the query (the labels are also in a specific language). As an evaluation metric, in addition to the accuracy discussed in §5, we evaluate the percentage of an- swers generated in the correct language. To do this, we use the OpenLID framework (Burchell et al., 2023). Figure 5 shows that CrossRAG achieves consistently higher rates than MultiRAG. More- over, monoRAG gets comparable performances to the baseline (no RAG approach), but the accuracy is significantly
