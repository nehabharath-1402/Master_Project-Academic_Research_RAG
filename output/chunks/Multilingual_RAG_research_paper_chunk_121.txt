used for conducting Translation-following experiment. H Translation-Following Results To make the experimental setting fair and consis- tent, we randomly extracted the same number of demonstrations for the languages available in the onen-source repositories.

However, we chose not to exclude these lan- guages from the final evaluation. Language MLQA MKQA German 69.8 67.5
