on the query Q from D, using a retrieval system R. During retrieval with R, the question Q and docu- ments in D are encoded, forming hQ = R(Q) ∈ Rn for query and hD = R(D) ∈Rn for docu- ments. Then, the similarity ⟨hQ, hD⟩is used to select a collection C from D, consisting of docu- ments that best match the query. Usually, to im- prove retrieval quality, the top most relevant doc- uments are filtered and ordered using a re-ranked model obtaining docs. Then, they are encoded to- gether with the
