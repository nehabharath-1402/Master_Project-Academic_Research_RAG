in §3.2 and perform the evaluations as pre- sented in §3.3. 3.1 Tasks & Datasets We use the following question-answering (QA) tasks: (i) MLQA (Lewis et al., 2020a), (ii) MKQA (Longpre et al., 2021) and (iii) XOR-TyDi QA (Asai et al., 2021) as they best represent multilin- gual open-ended question-answering tasks. These datasets are extensions of resources that originated in English. MLQA and MKQA are manually and machine-translated, whereas XOR-TyDi QA is translated by professional annotators.
