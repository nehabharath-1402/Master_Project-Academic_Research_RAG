performances (§5.2), the generated lan- guages (§5.1) and the robustness on challenging perturbations (§5.3). 4.1 The impact of RAG beyond English Figure 2 shows the results obtained from different LLMs when prompted with RAG-based strategies in monolingual and multilingual settings as intro- duced in §2. An overall improvement over baseline models without RAG can be observed using mono- lingual RAG, i.e., monoRAG (+8.9% improve- ment for GPT-4o, +7.9% improvement for Llama- 3-8b and +8.2%
