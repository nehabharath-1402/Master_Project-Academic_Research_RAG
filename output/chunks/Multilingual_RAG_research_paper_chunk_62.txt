we translated both retrieved documents and ques- tions (in two distinct experimental phases) and re- produced the experimental setting proposed earlier. Table 3 compares the results using two different systems. In the case of tRAG, there are no con- spicuous improvements (highest difference +1.9 in GPT-4 MKQA). Concerning CrossRAG, it can be observed that significant differences emerge be- tween the final results achieved by using Google Translate and GPT-4o. This further demonstrates (i) the
