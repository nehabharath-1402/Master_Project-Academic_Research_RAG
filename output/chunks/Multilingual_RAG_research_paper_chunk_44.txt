Figure 2: Performance comparison of models using RAG approaches described in §2 across benchmarks and settings detailed in §3, separated by average (Avg), high-resource (HR) and low-resource (LR) languages averages. The values above the bars are the differences with the baselines (no RAG scores). that address the language barrier using query trans- lation (tRAG). Indeed, although monolingual re- trieval (i.e., monoRAG) achieves benefits com- pared to the baseline, the retrieved documents may be
