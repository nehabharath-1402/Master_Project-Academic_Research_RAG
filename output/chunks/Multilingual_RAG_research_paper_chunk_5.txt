method that translates retrieved documents into a common language (e.g., English) before generating the response. Our experiments show that CrossRAG signif- icantly enhances performance on knowledge- intensive tasks, benefiting both high-resource and low-resource languages. 1 Introduction Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to im- prove the factuality and memory access of large language models (LLMs) by combining external knowledge during inference (Lewis et al., 2020b; Petroni et al.,
