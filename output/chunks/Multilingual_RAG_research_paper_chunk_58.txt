differences for model. around +2.5 for GPT-4o and Llama-3-8b and +3.4 for Command-R when compared to MultiRAG. In contrast, we note larger benefits for LR (respec- tively +3.7 for GPT-4o, +5 for Command-R and +4.1 for Llama-3-8b on average). These results highlight the limitations that the LLMs examined have when operating via MultiRAG concerning documents in multiple languages (see the case dis- cussed in §4.2 in Appendix Q. However, since the translation component mat- ters, we proposed the
