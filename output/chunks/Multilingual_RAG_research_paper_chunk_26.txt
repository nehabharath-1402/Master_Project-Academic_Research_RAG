that the query Q and A are in the same language, which we refer to as LSL. Consequently, the docs retrieved from DSL are in LSL. Hence, in this setting, we instruct the LLM using the template in Table 1, docs = top-k{hQSL,C} where C ∈DSL and QSL is in LSL. For the rest of the paper, we refer to this setting as monolingual RAG (monoRAG).
