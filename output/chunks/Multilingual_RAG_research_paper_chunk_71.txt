5.2 Retrieval Settings In our experimental setting (§3), we use Cohere as a retrieval tool. To observe the impact of the retrieval methodologies on the performances, we conducted a parallel experiment using BGE-m3 (Chen et al., 2024) as in (Chirkova et al., 2024) (detailed in Appendix E). Figure 6 shows the av- erage performances obtained by Llama-3-8b on the MKQA subset using the two different retrieval strategies. There are no conspicuous differences on average. This indicates that although
