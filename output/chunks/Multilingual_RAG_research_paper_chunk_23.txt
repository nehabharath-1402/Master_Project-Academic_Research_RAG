docs. Then, they are encoded to- gether with the query in hQ,C = R(Q, C) ∈R. This allows for hQ,C representations, which cap- ture similarities between the query and the docu- ments by improving quality and considering simi- larity, specific contexts, and semantic relevance to docs = top-k{hQ,C}. The retriever generally uses a ranker based on ar- chitectures trained on specific information retrieval datasets and a customised reranker. Since our work focuses on using such systems in a
