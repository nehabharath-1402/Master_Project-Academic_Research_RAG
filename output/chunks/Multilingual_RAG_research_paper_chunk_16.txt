English by showing the benefits derived from extending the range of retrieval to multilingual contexts. Firstly, we show that naïve approaches such as query translation (tRAG) generate incorrect trans- lations, leading to wrong retrieval and mis- leading generations, for instance, Appendix O. Instead, Multilingual RAG (MultiRAG), based on multilingual retrieval and language- specific queries, outperforms monolingual RAG (monoRAG) based on monolingual re- trieval sources in the query language. •
